The .poll function's time could depend on many factors, and so by checking right after the .poll function was called, there was not enough time given for this function to complete. In doing this, the .get() call would non-deterministically fail. The fix comes from giving the asynchronous call enough time to finish before checking the values of the .get() function. | https://github.com/Accenture/mercury,6b744cdbb2206feca62848df92b3bf542f890be5,extensions/rest-automation-lib,org.platformlambda.automation.tests.WebSocketTests.userChannelTest,NOD,DeveloperFixed,,https://github.com/Accenture/Mercury/commit/47663ff9c7803aa8613a81b3dff71ec9908e2d6e |

There appear to be no network issues as the network being utilized is the same for all tests, so I can't see why for this specific test network issues will appear to be a problem. There is no concurrency as well since the test class generates unique keys for each test instance using the thread name and a UUID. There is no randomness as the Bloom filter operations being tested are deterministic for the inputs. Finally, there are no asynchronous timing issues as the methods being called in the test are synchronous and blocking. A potential issue that I could see is the Redis server's state, but there appears to be no direct categorization of the flakiness into a defined category. | https://github.com/alibaba/alibabacloud-tairjedis-sdk,f6215930b9e21a5252c95296d9924b3c4524d9f6,.,com.aliyun.tair.tests.tairbloom.TairBloomClusterTest.bfaddTest,NOD,,, |
